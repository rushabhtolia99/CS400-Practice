There once was a cat named Joe, he was very happy with his family. One day, Joe found a mouse scurrying away from a picnic and decided to follow him because he was very hungry and
had not eaten anything that day. While Joe was following the mouse, he got distracted and got his tail stuck under a fence. Joe started getting scared and yelling out for his famliy
to come save him from his predicament. 

Joe yelled and yelled, but no one from his family seemed to come right away, and it was getting dark. Joe thought he could hear the shouts of his family, his name called out in the distance. Joe tried to yell more, but his voice was softer as his throat was sore from his earlier yells. Joe's efforts of moving his tail only hurt him more, so he dared not try anymore. Joe lost his family, and his mouse. He did not know what else to do, and Joe laid his head down, tired from his efforts, lacking motivation and desire to escape his ensnarement, and let a single tear roll down his face in sadness.
